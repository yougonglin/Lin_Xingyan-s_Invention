### 背景故事(Background story)
我被强制加入到脑联网，他们监视着我，将我的私生活开直播。我发明东西时，他们嘲笑我，将我的事情在脑联网里传播的到处都是，想让别人看我的笑话，想让别人给他直播打赏，当我发明完成时，又想抄袭我，想要到专利局里靠关系先申请专利。他们对我神经调控，调控我脑部血压想让我脑出血，剥夺我的睡眠，我的生命受到威胁。如有知道相关信息者请帮帮我。但请不要留下任何联系方式，避免对方找上你，可直接点击https://join.skype.com/invite/y0FUFsX5iab5

I was forced to join the Brain Network, and they monitored me, broadcasting my private life live. When I invented something, they ridiculed me and spread my story everywhere in the brain network, wanting others to see my jokes, wanting others to give him live streaming rewards. When I completed my invention, they wanted to copy me and apply for a patent at the patent office based on their connections. They are regulating my nerves and blood pressure in my brain to cause cerebral hemorrhage, deprive me of sleep, and threaten my life. If anyone knows the relevant information, please help me. But please do not leave any contact information to avoid the other party finding you. You can directly click on it https://join.skype.com/invite/y0FUFsX5iab5
